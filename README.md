###Known bugs:
Sugar may or may not be functioning correctly.

###Impressions of the assignment:
It was an eye opening project in the sense that we had to implement extensions half way through. This assignment truly tested the robustness and extensibility of our design to the fullest and exposed poor OOP design. The assignment was fun in groups but also a lot of work and time.
